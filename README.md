# PyCity_Challenge
The purpose of the PyCity analysis is to find the overall passing percentages of the students and understand if there is any correlation with the budget per student. It was discovered that some of the test scores from the 9th grade at Thomas High School were missing;  because of these missing values a thorough analysis was done inorder to identify the scores from Thomas High School.  

 **How is the District Summary affected?**																																				   
 Upon assessing average scores and passing percentages among the 15 high schools in the school district, the average math score has dropped by 0.1, however the average reading score remained the same. The percentage of both passing math and reading has dropped 1% hence the entire passing score has decreased by 1%.

**How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?**

**Math and reading scores by grade**

**Scores by school spending**

**Scores by school size**

**Scores by school type**

Neither Math nor reading scores are affected. The analysis was done because there were multiple NAN values for the 9th graders ;hence verifing weather the scores had significantly decreased or increased.
